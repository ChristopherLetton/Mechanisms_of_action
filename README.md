# Project
I used data collected through a cell-based assay designed to capture gene expression and cell viability levels.
Based on the patterns in this data, I created a model to predict a drug's mechanism of action (MoA).


# Assay & Data Collection
An assay is an investigational tool used in biology and chemistry for the detection or measurement of a target molecule's presence or functional activity.
The measurement of gene expression is based on the L1000 assay.
The measurement of cell viability is based on the PRISM assay.
